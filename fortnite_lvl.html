					<h2>Story</h2>
						There was an old, rich and powerful family that once lived upon a mountain, in a hidden
						village surrounded by rocks, there were rumors that they found a powerful crystal with some
						magic powers, no one ever could find out if this was true considering that nobody knew how
						to enter their village. <br>
						This nobel family started to watch over the crystal, like it has an own life, until their greed
						corrupted their soul. Years passed and there was no news from the family. <br>
						There were many bounty hunters that tried to find out the location of the village but no one
						did it, until one of the greatest, who had dedicated more than 20 years to this case, finally
						found a trail. He left his family and departed to his objective, but he never returned home.
						Ten years later his little brother, who was always obsessed with his big brother adventures,
						discovered his diaries, it took him more than 5 years to interpret the enigmas that hid the
						diaries. <br>
						Now that he finally believes he has found the right way to find the village, he is prepared to
						follow his big brother's path and find the village and the magic crystal, if it exists.

					<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
					<p>
						As a level designer, I was responsible to implement a series of challenges from a structured cadence chart. 
						The idea behind this is to introduce little by little the mechanics and dynamics the player can use, 
						so that in the end, he is capable to defeat the boss and complete the level. <br>
						Another responsibility I had was to design which elements of player guidance will be used inside the level,
						so that the player can be guided through the game and can understand which is the designed path to follow without getting lost.
