					<h1>Do It For The Beast: Fortnite Level</h1>
					<p class: "major">
					This level is designed  and created using Unreal Editor for Fortnite. The reference map is the OPD (one page dungeon) Do It For The Beast written by Michael Prescott.<br><br>
					
					There was an old, rich and powerful family that once lived upon a mountain, in a hidden
					village surrounded by rocks, there were rumors that they found a powerful crystal with some
					magic powers, no one ever could find out if this was true considering that nobody knew how
					to enter their village.<br>
					
					This nobel family started to watch over the crystal, like it has an own life, until their greed
					corrupted their soul. Years passed and there was no news from the family.
					There were many bounty hunters that tried to find out the location of the village but no one
					did it, until one of the greatest, who had dedicated more than 20 years to this case, finally
					found a trail. He left his family and departed to his objective, but he never returned home.<br>
					
					Ten years later his little brother, who was always obsessed with his big brother adventures,
					discovered his diaries, it took him more than 5 years to interpret the enigmas that hid the
					diaries.
					Now that he finally believes he has found the right way to find the village, he is prepared to
					follow his big brother's path and find the village and the magic crystal, if it exists.

					<h2>Creation and Design Procedure</h2>
					<p>
						First things first, we start by painting the terrain in the editor with a different texture in order to see a general layout of the map.
						Once we defined the most basic layout with some structures to limit the player path we were able to implement <b>Verticallity</b> into the level and define how
						the different zones will be interconnected. With this procedure, we create the structure of the map.<br><br>
						
						The next thing to implement are the <b>Challenges</b> that will explore the gameplay mechanics the player can use. In order to do this we create a <b>CCST Chart</b> to write down
						the different combinations of challenges along with a <b>Difficulty Progression Chart</b> to keep a track of the difficulty of those challenges.<br><br>
						
						Once the challenges are placed into the map, we want to implement the final piece of the level: <b>Player Guidance</b>. It is so important to implement it so the player can understand
						which path can be followed. In order to accomplish this matter, we use many player guidance techniques, such as <b>Texture</b>, <b>Motion</b>, <b>Affordance</b>, <b>Breadcrumbs</b>, <b>Landmarks</b>, <b>Leading Lines</b>,
						and many others. While implementing it we always take in account some basic photography knowledgle like the <b>Rule of Thirds</b>
